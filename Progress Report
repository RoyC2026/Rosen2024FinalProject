# Progress Report
Â Okay, so who knew making a discord bot was going to be hard definitely not me. I have gone pass the point of just messing with bot permission because nothing was appearing, and have moved over to replit which is super beginner friendly. I'm not actually working on the code for the bot instead of messing with the discord development tools and permissions.
